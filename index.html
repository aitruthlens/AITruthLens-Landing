    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
     At AI TruthLens, we believe everyone deserves access to the tools needed to understand what’s real online. With AI-generated images, videos, and text flooding social media and the news, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to tell the difference between authentic content and synthetic manipulation.
That’s why we created AI TruthLens — a simple, powerful way for anyone to instantly verify whether what they’re seeing was created by a human or generated by AI.
Once installed, the extension works seamlessly with your browser. Just right-click any image, video, or text anywhere on the internet and select “Detect for AI.” Within seconds, AI TruthLens provides a clear, detailed analysis—including which AI model was used for verification—so you always know exactly what you’re looking at.
We believe in transparency, accessibility, and empowering everyday people—not just corporations—to navigate a world where digital deception is easier than ever. AI TruthLens exists to restore trust, clarity, and confidence in the content we consume every day.

Equip yourself with the tools to fight misinformation.
Bring reality back into focus.
Experience AI TruthLens today.

    <p>
      We use trusted detection models and clearly show which verification provider analyzed each result.
      No confusion. No guessing. Just transparency.
